<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Starting in January, we’re providing a year-long class to help you succeed.</em></p>

We have some very thrilling news to share with you: In 2021, my colleague Alex McCauley and I will be teaming up and providing a real estate program called “Money Moves.” **In 2019 and 2020, we sold over $100 million in real estate combined**; we’re two of Houston’s top producers. We’ve received many calls from other real estate agents asking us about our process and how we achieved such success, so we decided to share it with you.&nbsp;

This class will help set you up for success in 2021. We’ll share the tips and tricks to set up the systems you need to succeed in this competitive market. This elite mentorship program is designed by Realtors for Realtors. **You don't have to spend thousands of dollars on coaches or lead generation**; we have you covered.

This is a year-long class that will be extremely hands-on, and we’ll provide custom planners like the ones we use so you can keep organized. We’ll be giving you homework and tasks to complete, but we’re doing it right along with you so we’re all kept accountable. We’ll also be doing a biweekly podcast you’ll have access to where we’ll dive into the current craziness of the real estate world. So many different things happen in this business; sometimes we laugh about it and sometimes we cry, but we’re putting it all out there for you to experience with us.&nbsp;
