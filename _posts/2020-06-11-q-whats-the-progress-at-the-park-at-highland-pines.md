<p style="text-align:center">Here’s an update on our latest new home development in Highland Pines.</p>

We’re back with the third episode of our series showcasing The Park at Highland Pines, a 32-townhome community in the heart of Acre Homes. Sergio Salazar from Calidad Builders is joining me to talk a bit about what has happened in the past few months.

**We recently finished the infrastructure for the development, including the water, sewer, and electrical systems.** Now that it’s done, we’re ready to build our first model homes. We’re very excited about working with Sergio because he has so much custom home building experience.&nbsp;

Sergio’s expertise is really what makes this development special. For those looking for a high-quality, custom-designed home under the $300,00 price point, this is the location for you.

Not only are you getting a custom-designed home, but you also get to live in a space with some great amenities. For example, the retention pond in the back is required by the city, but Sergio is turning it into a nice dog park.

**Acre Homes is an up-and-coming location in Houston** with retail, restaurants, entertainment, and more. Get in while you can.&nbsp;

If you have questions about The Park at Highland Pines or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
