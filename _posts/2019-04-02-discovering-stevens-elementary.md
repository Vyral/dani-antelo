For my latest community spotlight video, I’m featuring Stevens Elementary School. I live close enough to this school that I can hear the principal’s voice over the loudspeaker from outside my house, so it only made sense for me to come take a visit. 

Joining me for this spotlight is Tim Wetlin, a wraparound resource specialist who works with the school. In case you don’t know, a wraparound resource specialist is someone who helps with non-academic support within a school. Essentially, Tim assesses what the school needs and then matches those needs with community resources.

**For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of our conversation so that you can skip ahead to the section(s) that interest you the most: **

If you’d like to know more about how you can give back to our Oak Forest community, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help you.
