<p style="text-align:center"><em>I’m introducing the head builder of The Park at Highland Pines.</em></p>

Today I’m back at The Park at Highland Pines, a 32-acre townhome development in a fully gated community with a huge dog park in the back.&nbsp;

This time, I’m taking you on a journey of the entire process of building this subdivision. I also want to introduce you to the builder, Sergio Salazar from Calidad Builders.

Sergio started building in 2001 with his father. While he was in school at Texas A&M Monday through Thursday, he was helping build his parents’ custom home on the weekends. **After that, he and his father did a couple of spec properties and started to build custom homes professionally in 2009.**

Sergio loves the feeling of accomplishment he gets after creating a home or development from nothing. As you can see in the video above, it’s all dirt now. However, the project will be finishing up very soon and we can’t wait for you to see it.

**Calidad Builders is known for their quality, and that quality is evident in this project,** even if it’s a little different than what they did in the past.

To learn more about The Park at Highland Pines, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I’d also be happy to help answer any questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you.<br>&nbsp;
