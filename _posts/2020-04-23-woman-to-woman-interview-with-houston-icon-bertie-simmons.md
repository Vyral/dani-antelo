*As a sorrowful 10-year-old, Bertie Simmons swore she would fight for social justice here in Houston and across the nation. Today she shares a little bit of her story.*

I recently had the pleasure of sitting down with an iconic Houstonian: Dr. Bertie Simmons. After nearly 60 years of working as a trailblazing educator in the Houston Independent School District, Bertie published her memoir, “Whispers of Hope: The Story of My Life,” which incorporates previously written recollections of her impactful childhood friendship with a black girl in the Jim Crow South.

From raising funds to take gang-affiliated students to New York shortly after 9/11, to growing up in a toxic home environment, to the secret power of blueberries, Bertie and I covered it all in this open and honest woman-to-woman interview.&nbsp;

**Here’s an outline of our discussion with timestamps so that you can skip around to the section(s) that interest you the most:**
