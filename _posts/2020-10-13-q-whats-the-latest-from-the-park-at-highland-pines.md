*Here’s the latest news from The Park at Highland Pines.*

Welcome to my latest update from The Park at Highland Pines\!

What’s been happening since they poured the street? As you can see, we’re standing inside one of the individual, free-standing units, which features one of the four available floor plans for this subdivision. Head builder Sergio Salazar has a lot of experience building custom homes, so it’s not unusual to find details like the oversized window in the living room (1:12 in the video), which is rare in these types of homes.&nbsp;

These houses are projected to be completed by the end of December of this year, so **if you’re looking to make a move in the Houston area this winter, I highly recommend checking them out.**&nbsp;

If you have questions about The Park at Highland Pines or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
