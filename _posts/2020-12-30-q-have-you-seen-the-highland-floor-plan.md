<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Phase one of construction is complete, so here’s a look at our progress.</em></p>

We’re back once again for another visit to The Park at Highland Pines. Phase one is now completed and I’m so excited to show you the progress on this beautiful 32-townhome community, specifically the luxurious Highland floor plan.

**The Highland floor plan features over 1,800 square feet, three bedrooms, and 2.5 bathrooms.** The elegant, open kitchen features a waterfall island with a textured cascade finish and quartz countertops. The induction range oven is an upgrade and comes with pots and pans for your home-cooked meals and plenty of cabinet and storage space.

**The spacious and open living room features plenty of natural light and the luxury vinyl floors are scratch- and water-resistant.** The home also has the perfect-sized backyard—easy to maintain and perfect for entertaining.

The primary bedroom has all the features you could ask for, from oversized windows to tall ceilings and an oversized closet. The primary bath features dual vanities, a soaking tub, and floor-to-ceiling tile shower. The home also features two secondary bedrooms that can be utilized as an office space, gym, or spare guest room.

**Outside of the home, this gated community features eight guest parking spaces and a huge dog park.** The Park at Highland Pines is located in the booming Acre Homes community. There is so much upcoming development and nearby commerce for your convenience.

If you have any questions about The Park at Highland Pines or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
