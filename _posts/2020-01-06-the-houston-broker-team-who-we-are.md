We’re the Houston Broker Team, and we’d like to tell you a little bit about ourselves:&nbsp;

We’re fighters who go the extra mile, and we’ve always got your back. Our detailed buyer consultation helps us to determine your real estate goals from the jump, so **we can surpass your expectations.** When it comes to purchasing a home, we wrote the book—quite literally (“How to Buy a House in Houston, TX” by Daniela Antelo).&nbsp;

With over 25 years of combined real estate experience, we can point you in the right direction. From selecting the best lender to getting your house keys, we’re there with you every step of the way; no transaction is too big or small for our team.

For our sellers, we have a very strategic 10-point marketing strategy that will get your home sold for the highest price possible with the least amount of time. **Our extensive network and use of technology will set you up to win.**&nbsp;

The Houston Broker Team developed the HBT exclusive pre-listing review to get your home sold even before it hits the market; our open houses attract more traffic than any traditional open house.&nbsp;

With database management, client appreciation, and community building, we make sure nothing falls through the cracks.&nbsp;

Reach out to the Houston Broker Team today and find out how we can help with your real estate goals and you’ll end up with a trusted real estate advisor for life.
