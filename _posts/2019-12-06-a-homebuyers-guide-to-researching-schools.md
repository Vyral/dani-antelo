If you have children who are going to school, it will, of course, play a big part in your decision about what house to buy. But how do you know which schools are best for your children?

Well first, don’t pick a house only because it’s in a particular school zone, since that can change at any moment. A school that had an A+ rating one year could have a C- rating a few years later.&nbsp;

**I recommend to those searching for a new home and school to consider these four points:**

**1\. Take your child’s needs into account.** Are they better off in a larger-room environment or in a smaller classroom setting? &nbsp;Are they going to need any special programming? Do they participate in extracurricular activities? Really study what educational facets your child needs.

<br>**2\. Decide when the best time to move will be.** You don’t need to come up with an exact date, but if you’re looking for your child to start school in the fall and be able to immerse themselves, it’s best to start looking at properties in the summertime. This is a great time to allow you to transition into the area.

**3\. Research schools online.** One website I recommend is www.GreatSchools.org. This is a national nonprofit website that offers all sorts of information about schools, including rankings, parental feedback, and more. It’s a good place to start building a community and educating yourself on the schools you might consider for your child.

**4\. Visit a school in person.** Once you step into the school, you’ll get a sense for the environment that your child might experience. You’ll also have an opportunity to speak with staff to get an idea about class sizes, etc., and to speak to other parents about their experiences. This is the time to ask the hard questions, like about the school’s policies for handling discipline and safety issues, the extracurricular activities offered, how they use technology to assist the teaching process, and similar.

A happy child is part of a successful move, so be sure to do your homework in advance. You can compare your needs and lifestyle to the information you’ve gathered from the schools, helping you to make a successful match.
