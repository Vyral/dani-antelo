<p style="text-align:center">You’re invited to my latest open house at 5539 Lymbar Drive.</p>

I have a brand-new listing coming onto the market this weekend, and I want to invite you to a preview open house tomorrow to get your feedback and let you bring any buyers who might be interested. It’s located at 5539 Lymbar Drive and features 3,500 square feet of flex space that allows you to turn any room into anything you want. Additionally, it’s outside of the 500-year flood plain and within walking distance of JCC. To find out more, watch the short video above.&nbsp;
