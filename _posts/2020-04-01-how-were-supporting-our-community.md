*We want to give back during these uncertain times. If you’ve been directly affected by this pandemic, we would be happy to list your home for free.&nbsp;*

We hope you’re staying safe (and sane\!) during this challenging time. We want to support our community, so if you have lost your job due to the coronavirus or the oil and gas downturn, we will list your home for&nbsp;<u>FREE</u>. We will include a 3D Matterport tour so buyers can virtually walk through your home without stepping foot in it. This is in addition to our regular services which include professional staging and photography. We’re looking forward to being able to host traditional open houses again, but in the meantime, please remember you can "ask us anything." To hear more about what we’re doing to help, watch the video above.
