*Here’s why the power of staging shouldn’t be overlooked.*

Here’s a fun little experiment for the video above: Would you, as a homebuyer, prefer to buy the home at 0:13, or the one at 0:16? And why?&nbsp;

Well, it’s the same home in both pictures; staging does wonders\! **Did you know the Houston Broker Team offers staging as part of our services?** Our in-house staging company can stage vacant and occupied properties and create a plan tailored to your specific spaces.&nbsp;

In this competitive real estate market, we help you stand out. That means less time on the market and more money in your pocket\! If you have questions about how to sell a home in this market, give me a call or send me an email today; I'd be more than happy to have a chat with you\!
